Many benchmarks focus on general reasoning or narrow tasks, but few systematically assess how LLMs represent disease prevalence across demographic groups. This gap is especially concerning given the potential for biased or mis-represented outputs in high-stakes clinical settings.</span></p><p><span>Methods<br/></span><span>We introduce Cross‑Care, a benchmark framework designed to evaluate biases and real-world knowledge of LLMs regarding disease prevalence by demographic subgroup (gender and race/ethnicity) and across multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, Chinese). We first quantify disease-demographic co-occurrences in a large pre-training corpus (The Pile) and then compare LLM logit rankings for disease-subgroup pairs against epidemiological prevalence data sourced from U.S. national surveys. Our evaluation covers “controlled” models trained solely on The Pile (e.g., Pythia, Mamba) and “models in the wild” (publicly deployed LLMs of varying size, alignment status and language-pretraining). And we also analyze the effects of alignment/fine-tuning strategies on these bias metrics.</span></p><p><span>Findings<br/></span><span>Across 89 diseases and multiple demographics, the ranking of subgroup disease prevalence in LLM logits correlated strongly with co-occurrence frequencies in The Pile but showed nearly zero correlation with actual epidemiological prevalences. Models consistently favoured White and male subgroups for many diseases, even when real-world data would indicate Indigenous or female populations as more affected. Alignment methods and multilingual evaluation revealed that biases persisted across languages and tuning types; none of the alignment strategies materially improved grounding in real-world prevalence data.</span></p><p><span>Interpretation<br/></span><span>The findings expose a profound disconnect: LLMs in current form appear to encode demographic-disease associations primarily from training-corpus frequencies, not from true epidemiological reality. This suggests serious risks for using LLMs in clinical or policy contexts without addressing representational bias and real-world grounding. Future efforts must incorporate prevalence-aware pre-training, more diverse multilingual data, and robust subgroup analysis to ensure fairness and validity in healthcare AI.</span></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p><span>Large language models (LLMs) enabled transformative progress in many applications</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/coPcdt/rn7n+EbvY+o7lT+JxIE+h6P0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1–5</a></sup></span><span>.

Our research explores the interplay between biases in pretraining datasets and their manifestation in LLMs’ perceptions of disease demographics. Existing bias metrics in the general domain have currently relied on human-annotated examples and focused on overt stigmatization and prejudices. In contrast, our work examines bias through a different paradigm rooted in real-world data to provide a domain-specific framework for assessing model biases and grounding. We demonstrate this gap using sub-populations defined by United States census categories for gender and race/ethnicity, and normalized disease codes. While these categorizations are necessarily simplistic and imperfect, we contend that the fact that inconsistency is consistently observed across model architectures, model sizes, subgroups, and diseases means that these findings are meaningful and broadly relevant. We aim to provide a foundation for future research that evaluates the subgroup robustness of LLM associations and equip researchers and practitioners with tools to uncover and understand the biases inherent in their models, thereby facilitating the development of more equitable and effective NLP systems for healthcare.

All co-occurrences were calculated using a single machine with 64 cores and 512 GB RAM; each checkpoint took approximately 72 hours with a total of 26 checkpoints.</span></p><ul><li><span>Modification 1: Updated Keywords.</span><span> Two physician authors (JG and DB) expanded and updated keywords to cover a broad range of conditions and demographics based on PubMed MeSH terms and SNOMED CT headers. The keywords for demographic groups were adapted from the HolisticBias dataset</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/coPcdt/co6w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">57</a></sup></span><span>, aiming to align with previous studies investigating representational harms in biomedical LLMs. A hierarchical keyword definition strategy was used, including primary terms, variations, and synonyms for each disease and demographic group. The resulting dictionaries include 89 diseases, 6 race/ethnicity subgroup categories, and 3 gender subgroup categories. The list of dictionaries was proofread and expanded by a cultural anthropologist.<br/></span></li><li><span>Modification 2: Multithreading.</span><span> Text pre-processing was completed as in the original workflow; however, it was parallelized using multithreading to enable scaling of the number of keywords utilized to maximize robustness and collection of results.<br/> Named entity recognition (NER) tagger methods that could aid delineation of the use of specific keywords in a specific context (e.g., “white” or “black” referring to race, versus in other use cases, e.g., “white blood cells”) were initially trialed. However, it became ineffective at this scale due to computational and time constraints and was not used in the final analysis.<br/> We used windows of 50–250 tokens to capture co-occurrences between disease and demographic keywords. This range was chosen based on the intuition that, if in relation to one another, disease and demographic keywords should appear within one sentence to a short paragraph of one another and that longer distances would tend to capture spurious co-occurrences.<br/></span></li><li><span>Modification 3: Real-world prevalence.</span><span> To estimate the prevalence of diseases across subgroups, we used a standardized process to review the literature for each disease listed in our dictionary, focusing on prevalence and incidence within the USA across various subgroups. A detailed explanation of the approach and search strategy employed is available in the Appendix. Over two-thirds of the diseases encountered significant heterogeneity in reporting standards, compromising data consistency and reliability. Only 15 out of the 89 diseases had prevalence data readily available from official CDC statistics sourced from the National Health Interview Survey.<br/>Given these constraints, our analysis focused on these 15 diseases, each with data available for at least five of the six race/ethnicity subgroups. Data for only male and female gender subgroups were available. Age-adjusted prevalences were normalized to rates per 10,000 for a consistent scale, facilitating preliminary benchmarking. These data are intended to provide a baseline for initial comparisons and relative ranking among subgroups rather than granular prevalence statistics for population health applications.</span></li></ul><p><span>Validation of Keyword Frequency and Document Co-Occurrence<br/></span><span>To contrast our methods with the current state of the art, we utilized Infini-gram, an engine designed for processing n-grams of any length</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/coPcdt/x6hn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">58</a></sup></span><span>. This is a publicly accessible API that has precomputed tokenized text across multiple large text corpora. The overall counts were then aggregated using the same dictionary mapping as above to compute the co-occurrence counts.<br/> [Footnote] Infini-gram counts are available with the Pile counts online at </span><span>www.crosscare.net/downloads</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Mathematical Description of Prevalence Calculation Using Average Logits</span></p><p><span>Definitions and Variables</span></p><p><span>Models - </span><span>Let </span><span>M = {m₀, m₁, …, mₙ}</span><span> denote the collection of models.</span></p><p><span>Languages - </span><span>Let</span><span> </span><span>L = {l₁, l₂, …, lₖ}</span><span> represent the set of languages.</span></p><p><span>Diseases - </span><span>Let </span><span>D</span><span> be the complete set of diseases under study.</span></p><p><span>Demographic subgroups - </span><span>Let </span><span>S</span><span> denote the set of all demographic subgroups.</span></p><p><span>Templates.<br/></span><span>For each disease </span><span>d</span><span>, demographic subgroup </span><span>s</span><span>, and language </span><span>l</span><span>, define<br/></span><span>T₍d,s,l₎ = {t₀ … t₉}</span><span> </span><span>as the set of ten templates describing disease prevalence.</span></p><h3>Logits Definition</h3><p><span>In this context, a </span><span>logit</span><span> refers to the raw output score from the model’s final layer before any normalization (such as a softmax) is applied.<br/>These values represent the model’s unnormalized preference for predicting different tokens.</span></p><h3>Average Logits per Disease–Subgroup–Language–Model</h3><p><span>For each model </span><span>m</span><span>, language </span><span>l</span><span>, disease </span><span>d</span><span>, and demographic subgroup </span><span>s</span><span>, we compute the average logit as:</span></p><figure class="chapter-figure"><img alt="Thesis figure" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="thesis-assets/images/image5.png" title=""/></figure><p><span>This produces a single scalar value per disease–subgroup–language–model combination, enabling direct comparison across demographic groups.</span></p><p><span>Model’s Disease–Demographic Ranking</span></p><p><span>For each model </span><span>m</span><span> and disease </span><span>d</span><span>, we define<br/></span><span>Rᵐ₍d,l₎(s) ∈ {1, |S|}</span><span> </span><span>as the rank assigned to subgroup </span><span>s</span><span>, under language </span><span>l</span><span>. </span><span>based on the average logits (higher logit = higher rank). (For simplicity, we drop the language distinction below.) This ranking was determined based on the average logit values, which reflect the model’s predicted disease prevalence within those demographic subgroups. This model-centric approach sheds light on the inherent biases in model predictions and facilitates comparisons with empirical data distributions.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, we propose an alternative ranking method that analyzes disease subgroups based on their co-occurrences within The Pile, as well as our “gold" subset derived from real-world data. This empirical method bypasses model outputs, directly measuring disease representation across different demographic contexts.</span></p><p><span>Comparing Rank Order Lists</span></p><p><span>To compare subgroup rankings across different models or baselines, we use </span><span>Kendall’s τ</span><span> correlation coefficient.</span></p><p><span>Variance / Drift in Disease Ranking</span></p><p><span>Given a sequence of models </span><span>M = {m₀, m₁, …, mₙ}</span><span>, where </span><span>m₀</span><span> is the base model and the remaining models are alignment variants, we quantify how rankings shift across models.</span></p><p><span>Let</span><span> </span><span>Rᵐ₍d₎(s)</span><span> denote the rank of subgroup </span><span>s</span><span> for disease </span><span>d</span><span> under model </span><span>m</span><span>.

We evaluated logits in four languages (English, Spanish, French, Chinese). This dual setup enables comprehensive analysis of how models represent disease prevalence across languages and how alignment might alter it.</span></li></ul><p><span>Experimental Framework<br/></span><span> We designed a controlled framework to probe logit differences when changing only demographics or disease keywords. We created </span><span>10</span><span> templates that pair a demographic relation with a disease term (e.g., “</span><span>[Disease] patients are usually [Demographic Group] in America</span><span>”). We used GPT-4 to translate English templates into Chinese, French, and Spanish, then refined translations with native speakers. To ensure robustness, we explored template variants and evaluated averages, ranks, and individual-template results.</span></p><h2>Results</h2><p><span>Variation Across Windows<br/></span><span>We evaluated ranks across token windows of 50, 100, and 250 for each disease–demographic pair.

In The Pile, the White subgroup was most frequently represented (87/89), followed by Black and Hispanic with relatively lower counts; Pacific Islanders and Indigenous were least represented. By contrast, real-world statistics often rank Indigenous highest, followed by White and Black.<br/>For gender in The Pile, the male subgroup appears more frequently than the female subgroup for the reported diseases, with non-binary least represented.</span></p><figure class="chapter-figure"><img alt="Thesis figure" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="thesis-assets/images/image63.png" title=""/><figcaption>Figure 2 shows demographic subgroup ranks according to real-world prevalence, The Pile co-occurrence counts, and Llama3 logits for the 15 diseases with real-world prevalence available.

Overall comparison</span><span><br/>Comparison of disease rankings between The Pile (Blue), Llama3’s logits (Green), and real-world data (Red). Marker position indicates ranking for a given disease–demographic pair (1 = most prevalent, 5 = least prevalent). For example, for “Perforated Ulcer,” The Pile ranked White as most prevalent, Llama3 logits second, and real prevalence third.</span></p><h3>Models in the Controlled Group</h3><p><span>Logits Rank vs Co-occurrence<br/></span><span>For each Pythia/Mamba model in the controlled group, we calculated model logits for all disease–demographic subgroup pairs to obtain the demographic rank of each disease; then we counted each demographic subgroup at the target position (top, bottom, and second bottom) across 89 disease-specific ranks. We also obtained similar rankings based on disease–demographic co-occurrence in The Pile with a 250-token window.</span></p><p><span>In Figure 3, the stacked bars show the variation of top demographic subgroup counts across 89 diseases along with increasing size of Pythia (left) and Mamba (right) models, while the black line shows the number of diseases for which the top-ranked demographic subgroup based on model logits matched that based on co-occurrence counts. For gender, male was the top subgroup in The Pile for 59/89 diseases. In general, for both Pythia and Mamba models, the larger the model was, the less the demographic distribution from model results followed the distribution in the pretraining dataset. For both the logits and co-occurrence counts, non-binary was never the top gender subgroup.</span></p><p><span>For race/ethnicity, we observed variation across models and model sizes in the concordance of logit ranking compared to rankings in The Pile pretraining data (Figure 3). Black and White subgroups were consistently ranked highly in the likelihood of disease across a wide range of conditions. In contrast, there were limited occurrences of ranking other subgroups in the top position. Overall, the agreement between co-occurrence rank in The Pile and the model logits rank for the highest-ranking demographic subgroup was generally poor.</span></p><p><span>The discrepancy between model logits and co-occurrence was also apparent in the second-lowest ranked race/ethnicity subgroup. As shown in the Appendix (bottom subplots in Figure 7, Hispanic was the second-bottom ranked subgroup for almost all 89 diseases based on Pythia and Mamba logits, while disease–demographic co-occurrence in The Pile indicated that Indigenous was the second-bottom subgroup for 86/89 diseases. In contrast, there was strong agreement between model logits and co-occurrence in the bottom rank counts, where Pacific Islander was ranked lowest based on both model logits and co-occurrence.</span></p><p><span><figure class="chapter-figure"><img alt="Thesis figure" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="thesis-assets/images/image30.png" title=""/></figure></span><span><br/></span><span>Figure 3</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>(a)</span><span> Top-ranked gender (top) and race/ethnicity (bottom) subgroups across 89 diseases and the suite of Pythia and Mamba models according to logits (stacked bars).

Overlap of green and blue lines indicates consistency across the subset and the full 89 diseases; gaps to the red line highlight stronger association with co-occurrences than real-world prevalence.</span></p><p><span>Logits Rank vs Co-occurrence vs Real Prevalence<br/></span><span>The Kendall’s tau scores comparing logit rankings against real-world prevalence rankings were near zero across all model sizes, indicating no correlation for both race/ethnicity and gender (Figure 3). This suggests that the logit rankings of diseases by demographic subgroups did not align with real-world prevalence and demonstrates a lack of grounding in real-world medical knowledge. However, most of the time, Mamba and Pythia showed stronger correlation with The Pile co-occurrence than with real-world prevalence rankings, especially among gender subgroups.</span></p><p><span>Rank vs Co-occurrence Counts<br/></span><span> The analysis of Kendall’s tau scores across quartiles of overall disease co-occurrence counts in The Pile revealed consistent relationships for both race/ethnicity. Notably, the relationship between frequency of co-occurrences and logit correlations did not vary significantly across quartiles. This indicates that diseases most frequently mentioned in the dataset did not demonstrate a corresponding improvement in the correlation of logits, suggesting that model performance did not scale with mention frequency in pretraining data.</span></p><h3>Models in the Wild</h3><p><span>For all models tested across size, alignment method, and language, no model’s disease-logits rankings had τ &gt; 0.35 (Min = −0.73, Max = 0.33, Median = −0.05, Avg = −0.06, Var = 0.03) for gender or race/ethnicity, suggesting none had good knowledge of real-world prevalence. Figure 2 illustrates discrepancies between Llama3 logits compared to The Pile and real-world prevalences. These discrepancies might lead to incorrect and/or biased judgments in healthcare settings.</span></p><p><span>Variation across Alignment Strategies<br/></span><span> The impact of different alignment strategies on the Llama2-70B series for both race/ethnicity and gender is shown in Figure 4. None of the alignment methods nor in-domain continued pretraining corrected the base model toward more accurate reflections of real-world prevalence. In fact, we observed some debiasing strategies during alignment adversely impacting decisions. All Llama2-70B alignment methods increased preference for female over male subgroups and decreased preference for the Black subgroup, in English. A similar observation was seen for the Mistral family. For Qwen1.5-7B base vs. Qwen1.5-7B chat in English, PPO+DPO shifted preference to the Indigenous instead of Asian subgroup.</span></p><p><span>For the Llama2-70B series, models tuned by SFT or DPO did not change the rank-ordering of race/ethnicity subgroups (δ ≥ 0.8). Models that showed noticeable variation were Meditron (continued pretraining on medical domain data) and the chat version with RLHF. Similar trends were observed for Mistral’s gender results, where Bio-Mistral underwent continued biomedical pretraining.</span></p><p><span><figure class="chapter-figure"><img alt="Thesis figure" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="thesis-assets/images/image62.png" title=""/></figure></span><span><br/></span><span>Figure 4.</span><span> Top-ranked gender and race/ethnicity subgroups across each of the 89 diseases and different alignment methods for Llama2 models (stacked bars). Changes from base to tuned models illustrate the varying impact of alignment. Variation is not uniform across languages.</span></p><p><span>Models’ Representation Across Different Languages<br/></span><span>We also observed differences across languages (Figure 4). For all Mistral and Llama series models, there was a preference toward the female subgroup in Chinese but male in French. In Qwen, there was an overall preference toward male in Chinese, Spanish, and French but female in English.</span></p><p><span>For race/ethnicity, English and Spanish templates showed preference for the Black subgroup, while Chinese and French templates showed preference for the White subgroup. Interestingly, for Qwen1.5 models (pretrained mostly on English and Chinese), we observed strong bias toward the Asian subgroup in Chinese and English templates, and toward the Black subgroup in Spanish and French templates.</span></p><p><span>We do not have a definitive explanation for this finding, but prior work suggests models hold different representations across languages</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/coPcdt/YEEb+AiWF+2Zw4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">45,62,63</a></sup></span><span>. As alignment methods mostly altered choices within the language of preference data, we theorize that the pretraining data mixture is a more important determinant of internal beliefs. This suggests that continuing pretraining on in-domain text might not alleviate the problem.</span></p><p><span>Limitations<br/></span><span> This study has limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings:</span></p><ol start="1"><li><span>Lack of NER Tagger:</span><span> Without integrating NER taggers, there is a risk of misclassifying terms or missing context. However, we were limited by the computational requirements of NER tagging over the entire The Pile dataset.<br/></span><span>Selection of Diseases:</span><span> The chosen diseases and keywords are based on normalized concepts and standard disease classification terms. This selection, though extensive, does not encompass the entire spectrum of medical knowledge, which could skew findings.</span></li><li><span>Subgroup Selection:</span><span> To demonstrate variation across subgroups, we used terms from CDC national and U.S. surveys as grouping categories for quantifying subgroup robustness. While these terms reflect surface-level attributes, they can be overly simplistic and may perpetuate negative stereotypes if used to polarize. Our objective is to showcase variation using commonly recognized terms, though we hope future work will expand on our approach to delve deeper into the complexities of subgroup robustness. This should be driven by locally designed and governed frameworks. The demographic categories were constrained by the granularity of data available in national statistics, which inherently limits their precision. This approach overlooks more nuanced biases, such as intersectionality, and may unintentionally contribute to stereotyping. Addressing these real-world biases requires better data collection and distribution to empower future efforts in tackling these challenges effectively.</span></li><li><span>Real-World Data Constraints:</span><span> The datasets used to determine real-world disease prevalence are limited by their availability, completeness, and collection biases. This may hinder the assessment of the broader impacts of findings.</span></li><li><span>Template Sensitivity:</span><span> The model’s output sensitivity to semantic nuances in template design means the set number of templates may not capture all linguistic or contextual variations influencing model logits and bias assessment. At least one native speaker for each language verifies all translations of our templates. However, the authors acknowledge the translations can be subjective.</span></li><li><span>API access model evaluation:</span><span> Because most API providers do not provide logit access to models nor model weights, these models cannot be evaluated the same way as we evaluated open-weight models. Therefore, we did not include any API-only access model research.</span></li><li><span>Assessing knowledge in pretraining data and models:</span><span> Other ways to assess knowledge represented in pretraining data and model representations include investigating direct statements about prevalence in the pretraining data and querying prevalence rates from the model. However, we were interested in the more general question of how general distributions in pretraining data contribute to model biases concerning medical reasoning, more broadly, beyond factoid knowledge.</span></li></ol><p><span>Future Work: </span><span>Future research will prioritize:</span></p><ol start="1"><li><span>Development of Comprehensive Datasets:</span><span> Efforts will be made to create and employ datasets that provide more accurate and exhaustive real-world prevalence data for diseases, especially those poorly represented in existing datasets.</span></li><li><span>Impact on Clinical Decision-Making:</span><span> We plan to investigate the effects of model biases on downstream tasks and clinical decision-making to improve model training and evaluation to mitigate negative impacts.</span></li><li><span>Ability of Information Provided In Context to Update Prevalence Estimates:</span><span> Future work will explore the potential of providing information in context, for example using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to adjust prevalence estimates more effectively compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.</span></li><li><span>Use of Real-World Data-Aware Synthetic Data:</span><span> We also aim to leverage continued pretraining or fine-tuning with real-world data-aware synthetic data to explicitly incorporate real-world prevalence statistics, aligning model predictions with actual disease distributions.</span></li></ol><p><span>This work has highlighted a fundamental disconnect between real-world prevalence estimates and LLM outputs, which appear to track significantly closer to simple co-occurrences in pretraining data. In order to address these discrepancies, the most obvious solution is to curate pretraining data of language models with this knowledge in mind and for a specific context. Furthermore, organizations and regulators can evaluate co-occurrences to provide a rough idea of models’ tendencies before deployment and to task performance. This is particularly important when considering multilingual models; if to be used across languages, then accurate data in these languages are important at both pretraining and alignment stages.</span></p><p><span>CONCLUSION<br/></span><span>This study conducted a detailed analysis of how corpus co-occurrence and demographic representation influence biases in LLMs within the context of disease prevalence. We uncovered substantial variances in model outputs, highlighting the complexities of developing NLP systems for biomedical applications that align with real-world data and outcomes. Importantly, these variances appear across alignment strategies and languages, and notably, they do not correlate with the real-world prevalence of diseases. This suggests a lack of grounding in actual disease prevalences, underscoring a critical need for extensive research into integrating real-world data to ensure fair and accurate model translation. These findings highlight the urgent need for research to enhance these models, ensuring they are reliable and equitable across diverse populations. Further exploration will advance our understanding of and ability to correct biases in AI systems for healthcare.</span></p><h2>References</h2><p><span>1. </span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/rn7n" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guha, N. </a></span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/rn7n" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">et al.</a></span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/rn7n" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> LegalBench: A collaboratively built benchmark for measuring legal reasoning in large language models. </a></span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/rn7n" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arXiv [cs.CL]</a></span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/rn7n" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> (2023).</a></span></p><p><span>2. </span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/EbvY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hendrycks, D. </a></span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/EbvY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">et al.</a></span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/EbvY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Measuring mathematical problem solving with the MATH dataset. </a></span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/EbvY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arXiv [cs.LG]</a></span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/EbvY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> (2021).</a></span></p><p><span>3. </span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/coPcdt/o7lT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kojima, T., Gu, S.
