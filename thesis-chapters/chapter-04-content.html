Real-world evidence holds potential to improve our understanding of toxicities, but toxicity information is often only in clinical notes. We developed natural language processing (NLP) models to identify the presence and severity of esophagitis from notes of patients treated with thoracic RT.</span></p><h2>Methods</h2><p><span>Our corpus consisted of a gold-labeled data set of 1,524 clinical notes from 124 patients with lung cancer treated with RT, manually annotated for Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 esophagitis grade, and a silver-labeled data set of 2,420 notes from 1,832 patients from whom toxicity grades had been collected as structured data during clinical care. We fine-tuned statistical and pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers–based models for three esophagitis classification tasks: task 1, no esophagitis versus grade 1-3; task 2, grade ≤1 versus &gt;1; and task 3, no esophagitis versus grade 1 versus grade 2-3. Transferability was tested on 345 notes from patients with esophageal cancer undergoing RT.</span></p><h2>Findings</h2><p><span>Fine-tuning of PubMedBERT yielded the best performance. The best macro-F1 was 0.92, 0.82, and 0.74 for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Selecting the most informative note sections during fine-tuning improved macro-F1 by ≥2% for all tasks. Silver-labeled data improved the macro-F1 by ≥3% across all tasks. For the esophageal cancer notes, the best macro-F1 was 0.73, 0.74, and 0.65 for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, without additional fine-tuning.</span></p><h2>Interpretation</h2><p><span>To our knowledge, this is the first effort to automatically extract esophagitis toxicity severity according to CTCAE guidelines from clinical notes. This provides proof of concept for NLP-based automated detailed toxicity monitoring in expanded domains.</span></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p><span>Cancer treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) are an under-studied cancer outcome that have important impacts on patients' survival and quality-of-life. As cancer-specific survival improves,</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/3FHCb+AABc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,2</a></sup></span><span> a better understanding of the epidemiology, trajectories, and risk factors for TRAEs is urgently needed to support treatment decision-making and survivorship care. However, the vast majority of our understanding of TRAEs is from clinical trials, which are crucial but inherently limited in their ability to provide information on less common adverse events.</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/UtRQ+1JYj+QNjv+ZDik+TXva" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3–7</a></sup></span><span> </span></p><p><span>There is enormous potential for real-world evidence (RWE) from electronic health records (EHR) to supplement adverse event information from clinical trials.

Importantly, esophagitis and its severity are almost exclusively documented in clinical notes.</span></p><p><span>In this study, we aimed to develop NLP methods for automated extraction of esophagitis presence and severity in the clinical notes of patients with lung cancer treated with RT according to </span><span>National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE) guidelines.</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/krSV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">34</a></sup></span><span> </span><span>Specifically, we developed NLP methods for three classification tasks: 1) none vs. grade 1-3 esophagitis, 2) grade ≤1 vs. grade 2-3 esophagitis, and 3) none vs. grade 1 vs. grade 2-3 esophagitis. </span><span>No instances of grade 4 or 5 esophagitis existed in our datasets. </span><span>We explored cross-domain transferability in a cohort of esophageal cancer patients.</span></p><p><span>Patient population and data curation </span></p><p><span>Our study primarily used a gold-labeled lung cancer dataset of 1,524 notes from 124 non-small cell lung cancer patients who received RT at Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between 2015-2021. We included notes written from the start of RT up to one month after the last day of RT. </span></p><p><span>Notes were manually annotated for the presence and maximum inferrable CTCAE v5.0 grade of esophagitis when the document was written. To establish consistent scoring guidelines for esophagitis, we annotated notes for the presence of a documented esophagitis event and its grade. We adhered to CTCAE v5.0 guidelines and based scoring solely on the information present within the free text of the note being annotated. Of note, pain with swallowing was considered esophagitis, but dysphagia alone was not. Thirteen percent of notes were dual-annotated by a radiation oncologist (DSB) and a trained data scientist (NKR), with an inter-rater reliability of 96%. Then the remaining notes were single-annotated by a data scientist (NKR). This dataset was split into a train, development, and test set in a proportion of roughly 80:10:10. Notes from the same patient appeared in only one of the sets.</span></p><p><span>We also used a silver-labeled dataset of 2,420 notes from 1,832 patients who underwent RT for any cancer diagnosis between 2015-2021, had structured esophagitis grades available in their EHR, and were absent in our gold-labeled dataset. At our institution, patients are seen by their radiation oncologist for a weekly on-treatment visit focused on managing side effects during RT. During these visits, physicians may optionally enter toxicity grade as structured data. No other providers </span><span>document on treatment</span><span> toxicity as structured data. Thus, this dataset only consisted of on-treatment visit notes by radiation oncologists. These structured data were taken as-is for silver labels. These were considered silver labels because they are often copy-forwarded and use variable toxicity grading rubrics over time; no additional quality control was applied to these labels. During training, we used this set of silver-labeled data for data augmentation and cross-domain purposes. In this dataset, lung cancer (927/1,832 (50.6%)), esophageal cancer (167/1,832 (9.1%)), and spine metastases (138/1,832 (7.5%)) were the most common diagnoses. </span></p><p><span>In addition, we curated a cross-domain validation set of 345 notes from 75 patients with esophageal cancer whose notes were not present in the gold or silver-labeled dataset. These notes were single-annotated by a radiation oncologist (DSB) using the same annotation guidelines as above. </span></p><figure class="chapter-figure"><img alt="Thesis figure" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="thesis-assets/images/image42.png" title=""/><figcaption>Table 1 shows the patient-level characteristics of our datasets.

These sections were chosen as the most likely to contain informative information based on oncologist domain expertise.

Most commonly, false positives occurred in all models where only evidence of dysphagia was documented, but not esophagitis. Although dysphagia is, formally, a distinct diagnosis from esophagitis, they are frequently used interchangeably in practice and share overlapping signs, symptoms, and treatments. False positives were also found in negated, generic, or past descriptions of esophagitis. One patient had synchronous nausea/vomiting and esophagitis with several notes describing severe dehydration and malnutrition in which it was ambiguous, which was the driving etiology, leading to false positives.</span></p><figure class="chapter-figure"><img alt="Thesis figure" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="thesis-assets/images/image38.png" title=""/></figure><p><span>Comparison with structured EHR data</span></p><p><span>The best-performing NLP model for Task 1 predicted esophagitis perfectly for all 13 patients in the test set.

Similarly, only 25/124 patients in the overall dataset had an esophagitis ICD-10 code documented as structured data.</span></p><h2>Discussion</h2><p><span>This study provides proof-of-concept for the ability of NLP methods to automatically extract cancer treatment adverse event severity according to CTCAE grade from clinical notes. Our models for esophagitis extraction from the notes of patients undergoing RT for lung cancer performed well, with macro-F1 of 0.74-0.92. Unsurprisingly, performance dropped when the model was used cross-domain on notes of patients undergoing RT for esophageal cancer. We showed that our NLP methods supplemented the ICD-10 codes entered as structured data in the EHR for identifying patients with an esophagitis diagnosis, underscoring the importance of methods for text-based data extraction for adverse events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of NLP methods for cancer treatment-related adverse event severity scoring, and demonstrates the potential for computational methods to support high-quality RWE generation on adverse events.</span></p><p><span>Our study builds upon a recent body of work on NLP methods for cancer-treatment related adverse events. Hong et al. (2020) used Apache clinical Text Analysis Knowledge Extraction System to extract CTCAE terms from 100 RT OTV notes, and reported an F1 of 0.25-0.91 for identified present terms, and 0.12-0.92 negated terms.</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/oFTf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">18</a></sup></span><span> Gupta et al. (2021) developed patient-level classifiers of immune-related adverse events, achieving F1 scores of 0.59-0.71 for identifying the presence of the three most common immune-related adverse events.</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/dLcR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">19</a></sup></span><span> A recent study of extraction of cancer symptoms—a separate but related task—reported a deep learning model that performed well at identifying 80 symptoms.</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/QACZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20</a></sup></span><span> </span></p><p><span>Our study adds to the existing literature by providing evidence that NLP methods can extract the presence of adverse events and their severity. The impact of an adverse event on the patients’ ultimate outcomes is driven by how severe it is. Adverse events, including esophagitis, can be very mild and require no intervention or treatment modifications or may progress to severe, potentially deadly symptoms requiring hospitalization.</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/xj2E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">32</a></sup></span><span> While methods that extract the presence or absence of an adverse event are valuable for high-level monitoring, understanding the severity of the event is necessary for clinical decision-making and risk-stratification. In addition, severity extraction is necessary for monitoring and understanding expected trajectories of adverse events, which can guide intervention and surveillance strategies. Further, severity extraction according to a standardized grading system such as CTCAE is needed to compare trial-reported adverse event profiles to those in the real-world setting and to compare the adverse event burden across therapeutic strategies. </span></p><p><span>Our methods achieved the best results for the simplest task of identifying the presence or absence of esophagitis, not severity. The second task, which aimed to identify the presence or absence of esophagitis requiring medical intervention, required a more nuanced distinction between grade 1 and 2 esophagitis, but still performed very well for both classes. The third task aimed to identify whether a note documented no esophagitis, mild esophagitis, or esophagitis requiring medical intervention. While performance was excellent for classifying the absence of esophagitis, performance dropped for classifying grade 1 and grade 2-3 esophagitis. These findings likely relate to the subtle and somewhat subjective distinction between grade 1 and grade 2 esophagitis which may vary across providers, carry-forward errors due to documentation of previous esophagitis severity, and class imbalance. Nevertheless, our results are still solid, especially for the most clinically relevant task of identifying patients who require medical intervention for their esophagitis. Although the patient-level results are only exploratory given the small numbers, they motivate future efforts in automatically identifying maximum experienced CTCAE grades.</span></p><p><span>The cross-domain performance of our models on the notes of patients with esophageal cancer underlines the importance of domain adaptation methods. Out-of-domain performance loss is widely documented in clinical NLP </span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/vqsE+xAjY+botZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">45–47</a></sup></span><span> and is an active area of research.</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/rY53" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">48</a></sup></span><span> While it serves as a warning when applying adverse event methods across cancer diagnoses while also suggesting the future extensibility of such methods. Simply applying the models trained on the lung cancer dataset yielded marked performance decrements, which based on manual review was largely due to tumor-induced symptoms overlapping with esophagitis symptoms in esophageal cancer patients. We also note that while no gold-labeled data esophageal cancer patient data were used to train the model, the silver-labeled dataset included 167 notes from esophageal cancer patients, so this is not a completely out-of-domain evaluation.</span></p><p><span>We took advantage of silver-labeled data to improve the performance of our models. The structured adverse event data that we used to augment our fine-tuning dataset was from a broader cancer population and were only present for a specialized note type—RT on-treatment visits—but still improved performance in the dataset including a wide variety of note and author types. The types and completeness of structured data collected during clinical encounters vary by provider, visit type, and department. Our approach may be useful for other researchers dealing with small gold-labeled datasets, who may have access to structured data for a subset of note types and wish to extract similar data from more diverse clinical encounters.</span></p><p><span>Our study has limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Most importantly, our datasets presented a skewed distribution with under-represented Grade 3 toxicities, and no instances of grade 4 or 5. In addition, they come from a single institution, impacting generalizability. However, the lung cancer dataset reflected notes written by various provider types from various specialties, somewhat offsetting the generalizability concern. Our patient population was primarily white, potentially limiting the generalizability of our models to patients from different population groups. We had no CTCAE grade 4-5 esophagitis events in our dataset and so we could not develop models to classify these most severe esophagitis grades. Yet, severe adverse events are more readily available as structured data, which could supplement our methods if comprehensive, structured data are available.</span><span><sup class="citation-ref"><a class="citation-link" href="https://paperpile.com/c/M3S8Zv/ZpZn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">49</a></sup></span><span> Our methods do not automatically identify what treatment is the cause of the adverse events; rather, we aimed only to extract an esophagitis event during a time window in which patients are known to be at risk for RT-related esophagitis, but most patients evaluated received concurrent chemotherapy. Accurate attribution is a focus of future work.</span></p><p><span>In conclusion, our methods provide proof-of-concept that NLP methods can extract the severity of cancer treatment-related adverse events. Such technologies may play an important role in RWE generation for risk-prediction, comparative studies, and survivorship care; Phase IV studies; and clinical trial reporting. In the future, NLP methods for adverse event extraction could support clinical care and yield improved patient quality-of-life by rapidly identifying patients who may benefit from early intervention to prevent progression.</span></p><h2>References</h2><p><span>1. </span><span><a href="http://paperpile.com/b/M3S8Zv/3FHCb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Siegel, R.
