<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the many people and communities who supported me throughout this PhD.</p><p>First and foremost, I am deeply grateful to my supervisors and mentors, <strong>Prof. Hugo Aerts</strong> and <strong>Dr. Danielle S. Bitterman</strong>, for their mentorship, patience, and steady guidance. <strong>Hugo</strong> consistently encouraged me to think beyond the immediate project and aim for work that is both ambitious and clinically meaningful.</p><p>I owe a special, heartfelt thanks to <strong>Danielle</strong>. Beyond being an outstanding mentor, she has been a constant source of calm, care, and protection during the most uncertain parts of this journey. She taught me, often through small moments rather than formal lessons, what it means to lead with generosity while holding a high standard. I learned from her how to communicate with clarity, how to write with the reader in mind, and how to stay anchored in what matters clinically when the technical path is tempting but the real-world relevance is unclear. I am also grateful for how she showed up as a person by checking in when things were hard, taking time to support my growth, and modeling a kind of integrity and kindness that I hope to carry forward in my own career. In many ways, her mentorship shaped not just this thesis, but also the way I think about responsibility in medical AI.</p><p>I am also grateful to my assessment and reading committee for the time and care they put into reviewing this dissertation and helping shape it into a stronger piece of work. In particular, I would like to thank <strong>Prof. André Dekker</strong>, <strong>Prof. Jan Scholtes</strong>, <strong>Prof. Dirk de Ruysscher</strong>, <strong>Prof. Martha Palmer</strong>, and <strong>Prof. Steven Bethard</strong> for their thoughtful feedback and for taking on the responsibility of assessing this thesis. I also appreciate the support from the doctoral administration and PhD office at Maastricht University, and everyone involved in coordinating the procedures for the joint program.</p><p>This thesis would not have been possible without the colleagues, collaborators, and friends I have been fortunate to work with across Mass General Brigham and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the Harvard–MGB AIM program, and the broader research community around us. I am thankful to my co-authors and collaborators, especially <strong>Marco Guevara</strong>, <strong>Jack Gallifant</strong>, <strong>Zidi Xiong</strong>, <strong>Jirui Qi</strong>, <strong>Yuxin Xiao</strong>, <strong>Yingya Li</strong>, <strong>Sheng Lu</strong>, <strong>Sam Schmidgall</strong>, and <strong>Pedro Moreira</strong>, for their creativity, persistence, and willingness to iterate until the ideas and writing were truly clear. I also want to acknowledge the clinicians, domain experts, and reviewers who pushed me to treat evaluation as more than a metric, and to build systems that can withstand real clinical ambiguity.</p><p>I would also like to acknowledge earlier mentors and training that continue to shape how I think and write. My time at Boston Children’s Hospital’s Computational Health Informatics Program (CHIP), including the opportunity to learn from and work with <strong>Prof. Tim Miller</strong> and <strong>Prof. Guergana Savova</strong>, gave me a foundation in language, rigor, and careful reasoning that I still rely on today. I am also grateful for the community they built and the many awesome colleagues there whom I continue to learn from.</p><p>Finally, I want to thank my family and the people closest to me for their unwavering support. This journey came with long stretches of uncertainty, revisions that never seemed to end, and the quiet pressure of trying to do work that matters. My family has been a constant source of strength and perspective.</p><p>To my partner, <strong>Kaitlin</strong>, thank you for growing with me through this colorful period of my life. Your patience, steadiness, and encouragement not only shaped my ability to complete this thesis but also influenced who I became during the process. There were many moments when I could not see past the immediate stress, and you helped me zoom out, regain perspective, and keep going. I am grateful that we supported each other through the intensity of PhD life, and that the growth was shared with so many exciting adventures!</p><p>To my close friends, especially <strong>Sam</strong> and <strong>Peng</strong>, thank you for your unwavering support through this entire process. You were a constant, grounding presence, helping me remember that even slow daily progress is real progress, and lightening the journey when I needed it most. I am profoundly grateful to all those who helped me maintain perspective and continue my growth throughout this endeavor.</p><p>To all of you, thank you for making this work possible, and for making the journey so meaningful.</p>
